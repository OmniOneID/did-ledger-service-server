# 4. How to Run the Server
This chapter explains three methods to run the server.

The project source is located in the root directory, and depending on the method, you need to load and configure the source from that directory.

1. **Using an IDE**: You can open the project in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), set up the run configuration, and directly run the server. This method is useful when quickly testing code changes during development.

2. **Using console commands after building**: After building the project, you can run the server by executing the generated JAR file with a console command (`java -jar`). This method is mainly used when deploying or running the server in a production environment.

3. **Building with Docker**: You can build the server as a Docker image and run it as a Docker container. This method ensures consistency across environments and makes deployment and scaling easier.
   
## 4.1. Running with IntelliJ IDEA (Gradle Support)

IntelliJ IDEA is a widely used Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development. It supports build tools like Gradle, making project setup and dependency management very convenient. Since the DID Ledger Service server is built using Gradle, you can easily configure and run the server within IntelliJ IDEA.

### 4.1.1. Installing and Setting Up IntelliJ IDEA
1. Install IntelliJ. (Refer to the link below for installation instructions)

> **Reference Links**
> - [Download IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

### 4.1.2. Opening the Project in IntelliJ
- Launch IntelliJ and select `File -> New -> Project` from Existing Sources. When the file selection window appears, choose the 'did-ledger-service-server' folder from the repository cloned in [3.1. Cloning the Source Code](#31-cloning-the-source-code)
- When the project opens, the `build.gradle` file will be automatically recognized.
- Gradle will automatically download the necessary dependency files. Please wait until this process is completed.

### 4.1.3. Gradle Build
- In the Gradle tab in IntelliJ IDEA, run `Tasks -> build -> build`.
- Once the build is successfully completed, the project will be ready for execution.

### 4.1.4. Running the Server
- In the Gradle tab of IntelliJ IDEA, select `Tasks -> application -> bootRun` and run it.
- Gradle will automatically build and run the server.
- Check the console log for the message "Started [ApplicationName] in [time] seconds" to confirm that the server has started successfully.
- Once the server is running properly, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8094/swagger-ui/index.html to verify that the API documentation is displayed correctly through Swagger UI.

> **Note**
> - The DID Ledger Service server is initially configured to use the `sample` profile.
> - When the sample profile is set, the server will run without required configurations (e.g., database). For more details, refer to [6. Profile Configuration and Usage](#6-profile-configuration-and-usage)


<br/>

### 4.1.5. Server Configuration
- The server settings must be modified according to the deployment environment to ensure stable operation. For example, you need to adjust configuration elements such as database connection information, port numbers, blockchain integration details, etc., based on the specific environment.
- The server configuration files are located at `src/main/resource/config.`
- For detailed configuration instructions, please refer to [5. Configuration Guide.](#5-configuration-guide)

<br/>

## 4.2. Running the Server Using Console Commands

This section provides instructions on how to run the DID Ledger Service server using console commands. It explains the process of building the project with Gradle and running the server using the generated JAR file.

### 4.2.1. Gradle Build Command

- Build the source using `gradlew`:
  ```shell
    # Navigate to the cloned repository directory
    cd did-ledger-service-server

    # Grant execute permission to the Gradle Wrapper
    chmod 755 ./gradlew

    # Clean build the project (delete previous build files and rebuild)
    ./gradlew clean build
  ```
  > Note
  > - `gradlew` is short for Gradle Wrapper, a script used to run Gradle in a project. Even if Gradle is not installed locally, it automatically downloads and runs the version of Gradle specified by the project, allowing developers to build the project in a consistent environment, regardless of whether Gradle is installed.

- Navigate to the build folder and confirm that the JAR file has been generated:
    ```shell
      cd build/libs
      ls
    ```
- This command generates the file `did-ledger-service-server-2.0.0.jar`

<br/>

### 4.2.2. Running the Server
Run the server using the built JAR file:

```bash
java -jar did-ledger-service-server-2.0.0.jar
```

> **Note**
> - The DID Ledger Service server is initially configured to use the `sample` profile.
> - When the sample profile is set, the server will run without required configurations (e.g., database). For more details, refer to [6. Profile Configuration and Usage](#6-profile-configuration-and-usage)

<br/>

<br/>

### 4.2.4. Server Configuration

# 6. Profile Configuration and Usage

## 6.1. Profile Overview (`sample`, `dev`)
The DID Ledger Service server supports two profiles, `dev` and `sample`, to allow operation in various environments.

Each profile is designed to apply the appropriate settings for its environment. By default, the DID Ledger Service server is configured to use the `sample` profile, which is designed to run the server independently without connecting to external services such as a database or blockchain. The `sample` profile is ideal for testing API calls, allowing developers to quickly verify the basic functionality of the application. This profile returns fixed response data for all API calls, making it useful in early development environments.

Sample API calls are written as JUnit tests, which can be referenced when writing your own tests.

On the other hand, the `dev` profile is designed to perform actual operations. When using this profile, testing and validation with real data are possible. Activating the dev profile enables integration with external services such as databases and blockchain, allowing you to test the application's behavior in a real-world environment.


### 6.1.1. `sample` Profile
The `sample` profile is designed to run the server independently without connecting to external services (e.g., databases, blockchain). This profile is suitable for testing API calls, allowing developers to quickly verify the basic functionality of the application. It returns fixed response data for all API calls, making it useful in the early development stage or for functional testing. Since no integration with external systems is required, it provides an environment where the server can be run and tested standalone.

### 6.1.2. `dev` Profile
The `dev` profile includes settings suited for the development environment and is used on development servers. To use this profile, you will need configuration for the development environment's database and blockchain node.


## 6.2. How to Configure Profiles
This section explains how to switch profiles for each server operation method.

### 6.2.1. Running the Server Using an IDE
- **Select Configuration File:**  In the `src/main/resources path`, select the `application.yml` file.
- **Specify Profile:** In the IDE's Run/Debug Configurations, add the option `--spring.profiles.active={profile}` to activate the desired profile.
- **Apply Configuration:** The configuration file corresponding to the activated profile will be applied.

### 6.2.2. Running the Server Using Console Commands
- **Select Configuration File:** Prepare the profile-specific configuration files in the same directory as the built JAR file or in the directory where the configuration files are located.
- **Specify Profile:** Add the option `--spring.profiles.active={profile}` to the server startup command to activate the desired profile.
  
  ```bash
  java -jar build/libs/did-ledger-service-server-2.0.0.jar --spring.profiles.active={profile}
  ```

- **Apply Configuration:** The configuration file corresponding to the activated profile will be applied.

### 6.2.3. Running the Server Using Docker
- **Select Configuration File:** When creating a Docker image, specify the configuration file path in the Dockerfile, or mount external configuration files to the Docker container.
- **Specify Profile:** Set the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable in the Docker Compose file or the Docker run command to specify the profile.
  
  ```yaml
  environment:
    - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE={profile}
  ```

- **Apply Configuration:** The specified profile's configuration will be applied when the Docker container is executed.

By following these methods, you can flexibly switch profile-specific settings and easily apply the appropriate configuration for your project environment.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: did-ledger-service-server
    ports:
      - "8094:8094"
    volumes:
      - ${your-config-dir}:/app/config
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=sample
  
  postgres:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: ledger_service
      POSTGRES_USER: ledger_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_password_here
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
